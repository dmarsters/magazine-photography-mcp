    "tagline": "Raw documentary truth meets deliberate anti-polish rebellion in authentic subcultural storytelling.",
    "full_description": "This combination merges documentary photography's commitment to authentic truth-telling with Vice magazine's signature rejection of mainstream polish. The result is visceral, uncompromising documentation that captures subjects in their genuine environments while embracing technical imperfection as a mark of credibility. Unlike traditional documentary work that maintains professional technical standards, this approach deliberately pushes cheap equipment to its limits, creating harsh flash falloff, blown highlights, and digital noise that becomes part of the narrative.\n\nThe aesthetic celebrates the raw immediacy of disposable cameras and early digital sensors, where technical limitations become storytelling tools. Subjects are captured with documentary intimacy but processed through Vice's oversaturated, high-contrast filter that makes even quiet moments feel urgent and confrontational. Natural lighting gets pushed to extremes, while careful documentary composition gets filtered through snapshot casualness.\n\nThis style excels at documenting emerging subcultures, underground scenes, and marginalized communities with both respect and edge. It maintains documentary's ethical foundation while adding Vice's provocative visual language, creating images that feel simultaneously journalistic and rebellious. The intentional technical crudeness signals authenticity to viewers suspicious of mainstream media polish.",
