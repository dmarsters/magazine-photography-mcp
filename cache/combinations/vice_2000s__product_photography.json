    "full_description": "This provocative combination transforms pristine product photography through Vice's signature anti-establishment lens, creating deliberately crude commercial imagery that feels stolen from a late-night convenience store or underground market. Products are captured with harsh direct flash, crushed shadows, and blown highlights that would horrify traditional commercial photographers but deliver raw authenticity that cuts through polished marketing noise.\n\nThe approach abandons seamless backgrounds for cramped, claustrophobic spaces where products compete with chaotic environments. Oversaturated colors and heavy digital grain replace careful color correction, while tight crops and off-center framing reject traditional product showcase conventions. This isn't about making products look perfect—it's about making them feel real, immediate, and urgently desirable through their imperfection.\n\nThe aesthetic speaks to consumers tired of pristine marketing imagery, offering products that feel accessible rather than aspirational. Each image carries the energy of discovery, as if stumbling upon something authentic in a world of manufactured perfection. The deliberately amateur technique becomes a statement of credibility, suggesting these products exist in the real world rather than sterile marketing fantasies.",
    "visual_expectations": "Harsh flash creating dramatic shadows and blown highlights on product surfaces, extreme oversaturation making colors appear almost radioactive, heavy grain and digital artifacts degrading image quality, tight crops cutting off parts of products, cramped compositions with competing background elements.",
