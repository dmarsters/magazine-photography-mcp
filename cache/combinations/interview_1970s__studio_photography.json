    "full_description": "Factory Studio merges Andy Warhol's deliberately raw Interview magazine aesthetic with the technical precision of professional studio photography. This combination creates a fascinating tension between the underground art world's authentic immediacy and commercial photography's polished control. The result transforms Interview's characteristic high-contrast black and white grain and confrontational intimacy through the lens of controlled lighting and deliberate composition.\n\nThe aesthetic maintains Interview's shocking color pops and metallic silver accents while applying them within carefully lit studio environments. Subjects retain that direct, confrontational gaze that made Interview portraits so compelling, but now captured with the technical precision of professional strobes and controlled backgrounds. The harsh direct flash that defined Factory-era photography becomes calculated key lighting, while the deliberately amateur snapshot quality is refined through professional technique without losing its rebellious edge.\n\nThis style bridges the gap between art and commerce, creating images that feel both accessible and elevated. The controlled studio environment allows for the reproduction of Interview's experimental techniques—the grain, the overexposure, the deliberate flaws—but with intentional precision. It's anti-establishment aesthetics made repeatable, underground culture captured with mainstream tools.",
