    "full_description": "This radical fusion tears documentary photography from its clinical objectivity and hurls it into Ray Gun's analog chaos machine. Traditional documentary subjects—street scenes, social issues, human stories—are captured with journalistic integrity but then subjected to David Carson's deconstructive visual treatment. Images are layered with illegible typography, run through multiple photocopier generations until they fragment into abstract textures, and assembled in layouts that prioritize emotional impact over informational clarity.\n\nThe result challenges the very nature of documentary truth. A homeless encampment becomes a spread where crushed blacks and blown highlights merge with warped Emigre fonts spelling out testimonials that dissolve into visual noise. A factory worker's portrait is cropped mid-face, tilted 30 degrees, with interview text scattered across the image in sizes ranging from microscopic to billboard-scale. The documentary content remains authentic—real people, real situations, unposed moments—but the presentation screams with 90s alternative culture rebellion.\n\nThis approach transforms documentary photography from neutral observation into punk manifesto. The chaos doesn't diminish the subject matter's importance; it amplifies emotional resonance while questioning traditional media's claim to objective presentation. Every spread becomes a statement that truth can be communicated through destruction of conventional visual language.",
    "visual_expectations": "Authentic documentary subjects layered with illegible typography that bleeds across image boundaries, extreme contrast ratios with crushed blacks swallowing detail, photocopier artifacts creating analog noise over sharp 35mm imagery, tilted compositions breaking traditional magazine hierarchy, harsh unfiltered flash creating stark shadows beneath layers of transparent text overlays",
