    "reasoning": "Ray Gun's harsh flash photography and extreme contrast ratios perfectly align with low-key photography's dramatic lighting philosophy. Both styles emerged from 1990s alternative culture's rejection of polished commercial aesthetics in favor of raw, uncompromising visual statements."

    "full_description": "This fusion transforms low-key photography's classical drama through Ray Gun's anarchic lens, creating images that emerge from deep shadows with the raw intensity of 1990s alternative culture. The traditional elegance of selective illumination gets deconstructed through harsh, unfiltered lighting and intentional analog distortion, while maintaining the powerful contrast ratios that define both approaches. Subjects appear as fragments of light cutting through photocopier-textured darkness, with blown highlights and crushed blacks creating an aesthetic that's simultaneously sophisticated and rebellious. The result captures the underground music scene's confrontational energy while preserving the mysterious allure of shadow-dominated compositions, producing visuals that feel like album covers for bands that exist in the spaces between light and dark.",
    "visual_expectations": "Dramatic subjects emerging from heavily textured black backgrounds with photocopier grain and analog noise. Harsh directional lighting creating blown-out highlights against crushed shadow detail. High-contrast monochrome or aggressive neon accents cutting through predominantly dark compositions. Intentionally chaotic framing with subjects cropped unexpectedly. Heavy film grain and multiple-generation reproduction artifacts adding texture to shadow areas.",
