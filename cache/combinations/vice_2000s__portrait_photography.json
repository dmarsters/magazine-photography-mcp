    "tagline": "Brutal honesty meets portrait photography in Vice's signature anti-glamour style.",
    "full_description": "This style strips away every convention of flattering portraiture, replacing soft lighting and careful composition with harsh direct flash and deliberately crude framing. Subjects are caught in unflattering angles under buzzing fluorescent lights or blown-out flash, their faces emerging from crushed shadows with the stark honesty of a police booking photo. The aesthetic celebrates technical 'mistakes' - blown highlights, digital noise, and compression artifacts become tools of authenticity rather than problems to solve.\n\nColors are pushed to extremes, with oversaturated primaries and harsh neons creating an almost toxic visual environment that mirrors the underground scenes Vice documented. Skin tones are intentionally unflattering, with the harsh lighting revealing every pore and imperfection as badges of authenticity. The composition abandons traditional portrait rules, cramming subjects into claustrophobic frames with cropped body parts and off-center positioning that suggests snapshot spontaneity.\n\nThis approach transforms portrait photography from polished representation into raw documentation, where the subject's character emerges not through careful lighting and posing, but through the brutal honesty of unforgiving technical choices. It's portraiture for the club bathroom mirror generation - harsh, immediate, and unapologetically real.",
