    "full_description": "This combination channels the raw energy of 1990s alternative culture through the timeless power of monochrome photography. Ray Gun's revolutionary anti-design principles transform black and white images into fragmented visual statements that prioritize emotional impact over conventional beauty. The aesthetic embraces extreme contrast ratios, crushed blacks, and blown highlights as design elements rather than technical flaws.\n\nPhotographs become deconstructed through multiple generations of photocopier manipulation, creating heavy grain and analog artifacts that serve as texture rather than distraction. Typography crashes into imagery at chaotic angles, with illegible text functioning as pure visual element. The result is a deliberately disorienting experience where traditional photographic hierarchy dissolves into layered, collaged realities.\n\nThis style captures the rebellious spirit of underground music culture while elevating analog imperfections to high art. Every element rejects corporate polish in favor of authentic expression, creating photographs that feel like visual manifestations of distorted guitar feedback.",
    "visual_expectations": "Extremely high contrast black and white images with crushed shadows and blown highlights, heavy photocopier grain and streaks, warped typography overlaying photographs at impossible angles, multiple exposure effects creating ghosted layers, harsh unfiltered flash creating dramatic shadows.",
