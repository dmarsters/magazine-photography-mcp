    "tagline": "Product photography reimagined through the lens of 1970s documentary exploration and Kodachrome's legendary color palette.",
    "full_description": "This distinctive style merges the meticulous craft standards of commercial product photography with the warm, saturated aesthetic of National Geographic's golden age. Products are photographed with the same reverence and environmental consciousness that characterized 1970s documentary work, using Kodachrome's signature color science to imbue everyday objects with a sense of discovery and adventure.\n\nThe approach maintains product photography's technical precision while incorporating natural lighting techniques and the patient, storytelling approach of documentary masters. Deep cobalt backgrounds replace sterile white, warm amber lighting mimics golden hour conditions, and products are presented as artifacts worthy of exploration rather than mere commercial objects.\n\nEach image carries the weight of Kodachrome's rich emulsion depth and slightly warm color temperature, creating product photography that feels both nostalgic and premium. The result bridges the gap between commercial necessity and artistic vision, presenting products as objects of cultural and aesthetic significance rather than simple commodities.",
    "visual_expectations": "Rich Kodachrome color saturation with deep blues and warm ambers replacing neutral backgrounds, natural side-lighting creating dimensional shadows instead of flat studio illumination, ultra-sharp product details with slight film grain texture, layered compositions that give products environmental context, and the distinctive slightly magenta shadow cast characteristic of 1970s Kodachrome processing.",
