    "tagline": "Capturing buildings through the raw, rebellious lens of 1990s underground culture.",
    "full_description": "This striking fusion transforms sterile architectural documentation into gritty urban poetry. Buildings are captured with the same unflinching authenticity that Dazed brought to club culture - harsh fluorescent lighting reveals concrete textures, extreme close-ups fragment geometric patterns into abstract compositions, and high-contrast black and white processing strips away architectural glamour to expose raw structural truth. The deliberate amateur aesthetic creates an anti-establishment view of urban spaces, treating skyscrapers and brutalist housing blocks as subjects for rebellion rather than reverence.\n\nWhere traditional architectural photography seeks perfection and ideal lighting conditions, this approach embraces the accidental and imperfect. Blown-out highlights flatten glass facades into stark white voids, while crushed blacks turn building shadows into impenetrable darkness. The photocopier-degraded grain structure adds a DIY zine quality to even the most corporate structures. Off-center framing and awkward angles reject the measured precision typical of architectural documentation, instead capturing buildings as they're experienced by those living on society's margins.\n\nThis style reveals the underground perspective on urban environments - buildings as backdrops for youth culture rather than monuments to establishment power. The result feels like architectural photography shot by someone who spent their nights in illegal warehouse raves rather than studying design portfolios.",
    "visual_expectations": "Extreme high-contrast black and white processing that flattens architectural details into graphic shapes, heavy grain structure that degrades clean lines into rough textures, harsh unflattering lighting that creates dramatic shadows on building facades, awkward off-center compositions that fragment geometric patterns, blown-out highlights turning glass surfaces into stark white voids.",
