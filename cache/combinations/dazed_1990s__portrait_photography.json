    "full_description": "This hybrid approach transforms classical portrait photography through the gritty, anti-establishment aesthetic of early Dazed magazine. Instead of the polished perfection typical of traditional portraiture, subjects are captured with harsh fluorescent lighting, blown-out highlights, and deliberately unflattering angles that reveal raw authenticity. The technical precision of portrait photography meets the DIY punk sensibility, creating images that are simultaneously intimate and confrontational.\n\nThe resulting portraits abandon conventional beauty standards in favor of documenting genuine character and edge. High-contrast black and white processing with heavy grain structure replaces smooth skin tones and perfect lighting. Subjects are often positioned awkwardly or shot with extreme close-ups that feel invasive yet honest, capturing the rebellious spirit of underground youth culture.\n\nThis aesthetic works particularly well for musicians, artists, and creative individuals who embody alternative culture. The portraits feel like documentation of a movement rather than traditional headshots, with each image carrying the weight of cultural rebellion and authentic self-expression that defined the era.",
    "visual_expectations": "Harsh, unflattering lighting creating dramatic shadows across faces, heavy film grain and high contrast processing, deliberately amateur snapshot compositions with off-center framing, blown-out highlights and crushed blacks that push technical limits, photocopier-style degradation effects overlaying portrait subjects",
