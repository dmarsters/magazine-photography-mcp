    "full_description": "This radical fusion transforms pristine fashion imagery into analog punk art, where couture models emerge through layers of photocopier distortion and intentional chaos. Clean studio lighting gets corrupted by harsh flash and blown highlights, while carefully composed fashion shots are fragmented across broken grid systems and overlaid with illegible typography that treats text as pure visual texture. The result challenges both fashion photography's aspirational perfection and Ray Gun's underground authenticity.\n\nGarments become abstract forms through multiple-generation photocopying and analog manipulation, their textures amplified into grainy, high-contrast statements. Models appear cropped mid-pose, tilted at disorienting angles, with their polished beauty disrupted by intentional technical 'failures' - crushed blacks, blown whites, and the raw energy of 1990s alternative culture colliding with haute couture sensibilities.\n\nThis approach transforms fashion photography from commercial perfection into cultural commentary, using Carson's deconstructive techniques to question beauty standards and luxury marketing. The precision of medium format fashion work gets deliberately degraded into something more honest and rebellious, creating imagery that belongs equally in underground zines and high-end galleries.",
    "visual_expectations": "Models fragmented across tilted compositions with harsh, unfiltered lighting creating dramatic shadows. Garment details lost and found through layers of photocopier distortion and analog noise. Typography overlapping fashion imagery, often illegible but creating powerful graphic textures. High contrast black and white processing with aggressive grain and intentional clipping.",
