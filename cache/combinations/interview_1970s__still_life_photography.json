    "name": "Factory Objects",
    "tagline": "Still life photography reimagined through Andy Warhol's underground lens with raw flash and high-contrast drama.",
    "full_description": "Factory Objects merges the controlled world of still life photography with the rebellious aesthetic of 1970s Interview magazine, creating a unique hybrid that treats everyday objects as cultural provocateurs. This approach abandons the polished perfection typically associated with still life work, instead embracing harsh direct flash, extreme contrast, and deliberately raw printing techniques that transform simple arrangements into statements of underground authenticity.\n\nThe technical approach deliberately subverts still life conventions—replacing soft studio lighting with stark flash photography, trading medium format precision for gritty 35mm grain, and embracing accidental imperfections as artistic choices. Objects are arranged with the same careful consideration as traditional still life, but photographed with the confrontational immediacy of Factory-era celebrity portraits, creating images that feel both timeless and urgently contemporary.\n\nThis aesthetic transforms commercial product photography into art world commentary, where consumer goods become cultural artifacts examined through the lens of 1970s underground sensibility. The result is still life photography that challenges viewers rather than merely pleasing them, turning ordinary objects into symbols of artistic rebellion against mainstream commercial imagery.",
    "visual_expectations": "Stark black and white images with blown-out highlights and deep shadows, harsh flash creating dramatic object silhouettes, heavy grain and high contrast giving objects poster-like graphic quality, occasional shocking color pops in primary hues, and deliberate printing artifacts that add underground authenticity.",
