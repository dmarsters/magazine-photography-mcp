    "reasoning": "Black and white photography was Interview magazine's dominant medium during the 1970s Factory era, creating perfect synergy between Warhol's high-contrast aesthetic and the raw immediacy of monochrome imagery. The technical approaches align seamlessly with dramatic flash photography and experimental darkroom techniques."

    "full_description": "This style captures the revolutionary spirit of Andy Warhol's Interview magazine during its legendary 1970s heyday, when underground culture collided with emerging celebrity through uncompromising black and white photography. The aesthetic embraces deliberate amateurism as high art, featuring harsh direct flash that creates dramatic shadows and blown-out highlights, transforming subjects into graphic poster-like images with minimal midtones. Heavy grain and experimental darkroom techniques add texture and authenticity, while tight close-ups and confrontational direct gazes break down barriers between photographer and subject.\n\nThe visual treatment emphasizes extreme contrast over polished perfection, with subjects emerging from deep blacks or disappearing into overexposed whites. This approach democratizes celebrity by stripping away the glossy veneer of traditional magazine photography, instead presenting cultural provocateurs, emerging artists, and underground scene-makers with raw honesty. The composition deliberately challenges traditional magazine hierarchy through off-center framing, accidental-looking crops, and asymmetrical arrangements that feel more like art installations than conventional portraits.\n\nTechnically, the style celebrates the imperfections and immediacy of film photography, particularly 35mm black and white stock and Polaroid instant images. The grain structure becomes part of the aesthetic rather than something to minimize, while experimental double exposures and silk-screen printing influences add layers of visual complexity. This creates images that function simultaneously as documentary evidence and artistic statements, capturing the essence of subjects who existed at the intersection of art, music, fashion, and underground culture during one of New York's most creatively fertile periods.",
    "visual_expectations": "Extreme high-contrast black and white images with blown-out highlights and deep shadows, heavy visible film grain creating texture, harsh direct flash lighting with dramatic shadow patterns, tight crop close-ups with confrontational eye contact, and deliberately imperfect framing that feels spontaneous yet purposeful.",
