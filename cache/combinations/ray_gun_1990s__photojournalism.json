    "tagline": "Raw photojournalism torn apart and reconstructed through Ray Gun's deconstructed visual anarchy.",
    "full_description": "This explosive combination transforms traditional documentary photography into a fragmented visual assault that mirrors the chaos of the stories being told. Clean photojournalistic images are fed through Ray Gun's analog meat grinder of photocopier distortion, crushed blacks, and illegible typography that bleeds across the frame like urgent breaking news ticker tape. The result maintains journalism's commitment to truth while acknowledging that reality itself has become fractured and overwhelming. Sharp documentary moments are layered with heavy grain, blown-out highlights, and text elements that crash into the image like breaking news alerts. The aesthetic suggests information overload and media saturation while preserving the emotional impact of real human stories. Where traditional photojournalism seeks clarity, this approach embraces the visual noise of modern information consumption, creating layouts where readability battles with raw expression and often loses intentionally.",
