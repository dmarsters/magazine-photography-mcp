  "technical": {
    "focal_length": "35mm-85mm standard lenses preferred for natural perspective; 24-35mm wide-angle for environmental context; 85-135mm for intimate portraits without intrusion",
    "depth_of_field": "Variable based on narrative needs - deep DOF for environmental context, moderate DOF for subject isolation while maintaining background information",
    "shutter_speed": "1/60s-1/250s for handheld stability; faster speeds 1/125s-1/500s for action/movement; slower speeds acceptable with stabilization for available light",
    "lighting": "Natural/available light preferred; minimal artificial lighting to preserve authenticity; reflectors and fill flash used subtly when necessary",
    "camera_format": "35mm film historically dominant; full-frame digital sensors; some medium format for higher quality archival work; rangefinders and SLRs for discretion"
  },
  "aesthetic": {
    "composition": "Strong geometric compositions; rule of thirds; leading lines; framing through environmental elements; balanced but not overly stylized arrangements",
    "subject_background": "Background provides context and narrative information; environmental elements support story; careful attention to avoid distracting elements",
    "tonal_range": "Full tonal range with good shadow and highlight detail; moderate contrast; emphasis on detail retention over dramatic effect",
    "color_approach": "Natural color rendition; muted, realistic palettes; black and white common for timeless quality and focus on content over aesthetics",
    "texture_detail": "High attention to texture and fine detail; sharp focus where narratively important; preservation of environmental textures and surfaces"
  },
  "shooting_approach": {
    "subject_distance": "Variable - close for intimate human moments, medium distance for subject-environment relationship, wider for contextual scenes",
    "angle_perspective": "Eye-level perspective most common for human connection; slight variations for narrative emphasis; avoid extreme angles that distract from subject",
    "subject_relationship": "Primarily candid and unposed; subjects often unaware or comfortable with photographer; natural expressions and body language prioritized",
    "environment": "Real-world locations essential; subjects photographed in their natural environments; studio work rare except for formal portrait documentation"

    "historical_context": "Emerged in 1930s with photographers like Walker Evans and Dorothea Lange during Great Depression; formalized through FSA projects; evolved through civil rights era and continues as digital medium",
