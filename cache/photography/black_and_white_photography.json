    "focal_length": "Variable - 35mm-85mm for street/documentary, 50mm classic standard, 85mm-135mm for portraits, wide angle 24-35mm for landscapes",
    "depth_of_field": "Variable - shallow f/1.4-f/2.8 for portraits/isolation, deep f/8-f/16 for landscapes/street scenes, driven by creative intent",
    "shutter_speed": "1/60s-1/250s for handheld work, 1/500s+ for action, long exposures 1s+ for creative effects, varies by subject",
    "lighting": "Emphasis on contrast and form - dramatic side lighting, Rembrandt lighting for portraits, golden hour, harsh shadows acceptable, window light preferred",
    "camera_format": "35mm film historically dominant, medium format 6x6/6x7 for studio work, modern digital full-frame sensors"
  },
  "aesthetic": {
    "composition": "Strong geometric elements, rule of thirds, leading lines emphasized, negative space crucial, symmetry and patterns highlighted",
    "subject_background": "High contrast separation, background often simplified or darkened, subject isolation through tonal contrast rather than color",
    "tonal_range": "Full range from pure black to pure white preferred, rich midtones, dramatic contrast often favored over flat lighting",
    "color_approach": "Monochromatic grayscale only - red filter effects for dramatic skies, yellow for natural tones, blue for increased contrast",
    "texture_detail": "Texture heavily emphasized - skin detail, fabric weave, architectural surfaces, grain structure often celebrated rather than minimized"

  "shooting_approach": {
    "subject_distance": "Variable by genre - intimate close-ups for portraits, medium distance for environmental context, wide establishing shots for landscapes",
    "angle_perspective": "Eye-level classic, low angles for drama/power, high angles for context, Dutch angles rarely used except for creative effect",
    "subject_relationship": "Both posed and candid traditions strong - formal studio portraits, street photography candids, documentary approach",
    "environment": "All environments - controlled studio lighting, natural outdoor light, urban street contexts, available light interiors"
