  "technical": {
    "focal_length": "85-135mm for headshots, 50-85mm for environmental portraits, wide aperture lenses preferred (f/1.4-f/2.8)",
    "depth_of_field": "Shallow DOF dominant (f/1.4-f/4) for subject isolation, occasionally deep DOF for environmental context",
    "shutter_speed": "1/60s-1/250s for static poses, 1/125s minimum for handheld to avoid camera shake",
    "lighting": "Soft, directional lighting preferred - studio strobes, softboxes, natural window light, reflectors for fill",
    "camera_format": "Full-frame and medium format for professional work, APS-C acceptable, mirrorless increasingly common"
  },
  "aesthetic": {
    "composition": "Rule of thirds for eye placement, leading lines toward subject, negative space for impact, tight framing on face/upper body",
    "subject_background": "Background secondary to subject - either creamy bokeh, simple textures, or contextual environments that don't compete",
    "tonal_range": "Moderate to high contrast emphasizing facial features, careful shadow/highlight balance on skin tones",
    "color_approach": "Accurate skin tone reproduction paramount, often warmer color temperature (3200-5600K), muted backgrounds",
    "texture_detail": "Sharp focus on eyes essential, skin texture balanced - detailed but flattering, fabric and hair texture secondary"
  },
  "shooting_approach": {
    "subject_distance": "3-8 feet typical working distance to avoid perspective distortion, closer for intimate headshots",
    "angle_perspective": "Eye level or slightly above, 45-degree lighting angle common, avoid extreme high/low angles",
    "subject_relationship": "Mix of posed and candid moments, formal business portraits vs intimate personal portraits",
    "environment": "Controlled studio settings, natural outdoor locations, architectural backgrounds, subject's natural environment"
