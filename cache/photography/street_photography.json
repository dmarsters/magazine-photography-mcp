  "name": "Street Photography",
  "technical": {
    "focal_length": "35mm and 50mm most common, with 28mm and 85mm also popular; wide-angle for environmental context, normal for natural perspective",
    "depth_of_field": "Variable - often moderate to deep (f/5.6-f/11) for zone focusing and sharp backgrounds, occasionally shallow for subject isolation",
    "shutter_speed": "Fast enough to freeze motion (1/125s-1/500s), sometimes slower for intentional blur or panning effects",
    "lighting": "Available light preferred - natural daylight, artificial street lighting, neon signs, window light; minimal or no flash to maintain candidness",
    "camera_format": "35mm film historically dominant, now full-frame and APS-C digital; rangefinders and compact cameras favored for discretion"
  },
  "aesthetic": {
    "composition": "Rule of thirds, leading lines, framing within frames, layered compositions, geometric patterns, decisive moment timing",
    "subject_background": "Background integral to storytelling - urban architecture, signage, crowds provide context and narrative depth",
    "tonal_range": "High contrast often preferred, deep blacks and bright whites, though can vary from high-key to low-key depending on mood",
    "color_approach": "Both B&W and color - B&W for timeless quality and focus on form/light, color for contemporary urban vibrancy and cultural documentation",
    "texture_detail": "Sharp detail throughout scene typical, capturing urban textures - concrete, metal, glass, fabric, weathered surfaces"
  },
  "shooting_approach": {
    "subject_distance": "Varies widely - close for intimate human moments, medium for interaction with environment, distant for environmental context",
    "angle_perspective": "Eye-level most common for natural perspective, low angles for drama, high angles for overview of urban scenes",
    "subject_relationship": "Predominantly candid and unposed, subjects often unaware of photographer, capturing authentic human behavior",
    "environment": "Urban streets, public spaces, markets, transportation hubs, sidewalks - anywhere public life unfolds naturally"
