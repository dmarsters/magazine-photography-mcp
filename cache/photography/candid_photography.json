  "name": "Candid Photography",
  "technical": {
    "focal_length": "35mm-85mm for street candids, 70-200mm for distant subjects, wide-angle 24-35mm for environmental context",
    "depth_of_field": "Variable - shallow f/1.4-2.8 for subject isolation, moderate f/4-5.6 for group context, deep f/8-11 for environmental storytelling",
    "shutter_speed": "Fast 1/125s-1/500s+ to freeze natural movement, sometimes slower 1/60s-1/30s for intentional motion blur",
    "lighting": "Available light priority - natural window light, ambient indoor/outdoor lighting, minimal flash use, high ISO capability essential",
    "camera_format": "35mm film historically, digital full-frame/APS-C, rangefinders and mirrorless for discretion, fast autofocus systems"
  },
  "aesthetic": {
    "composition": "Rule of thirds relaxed, off-center subjects, tilted horizons acceptable, foreground/background interaction, authentic moment over perfect composition",
    "subject_background": "Background often busy/realistic, environmental context crucial, subjects naturally integrated into surroundings, layered compositions",
    "tonal_range": "Natural contrast reflecting actual lighting conditions, shadows may be blocked, highlights may blow - authenticity over technical perfection",
    "color_approach": "Natural color temperature variations, mixed lighting accepted, desaturated earth tones common, realistic skin tones priority",
    "texture_detail": "Natural texture preservation, grain/noise acceptable, sharp focus on key subjects but soft focus acceptable for motion/emotion"
  },
  "shooting_approach": {
    "subject_distance": "Variable - close 3-10 feet for intimacy, medium 10-25 feet for context, distant 25+ feet for unobtrusive observation",
    "angle_perspective": "Eye level predominant, occasional low/high angles when naturally occurring, handheld camera shake acceptable",
    "subject_relationship": "Purely candid - subjects unaware or natural, genuine emotions and expressions, unposed body language",
    "environment": "Natural locations - streets, homes, events, workplaces, public spaces, real environments over controlled settings"

    "historical_context": "Emerged 1920s-1930s with portable cameras (Leica), popularized by Henri Cartier-Bresson's 'decisive moment' concept, evolved through street photography movement",
