  "technical": {
    "focal_length": "35mm-85mm for versatility, 24-70mm zooms common, 50mm standard for natural perspective, telephoto 200-400mm for distant subjects",
    "depth_of_field": "Variable based on story needs - shallow for subject isolation, deep for environmental context, typically f/5.6-f/8 for balance",
    "shutter_speed": "1/125s minimum for handheld stability, 1/250s+ for action, varies with available light constraints",
    "lighting": "Available light preferred, minimal flash to maintain authenticity, natural window light, street lighting, emergency lighting",
    "camera_format": "35mm film historically, digital DSLR/mirrorless now standard, full-frame sensors preferred for low-light performance"
  },
  "aesthetic": {
    "composition": "Rule of thirds, leading lines, decisive moment timing, strong foreground-background relationships, geometric balance",
    "subject_background": "Background provides context and story information, environmental elements support narrative, careful attention to distracting elements",
    "tonal_range": "Full tonal range preferred, moderate to high contrast, shadow detail retention important, highlights controlled",
    "color_approach": "Natural color rendition, desaturated palette often preferred, black and white for timeless impact, color used to support story",
    "texture_detail": "Sharp detail throughout important areas, texture used to convey emotion and atmosphere, grain acceptable for authenticity"
  },
  "shooting_approach": {
    "subject_distance": "Varies from intimate close-ups to wide environmental shots, often middle distance for human connection while showing context",
    "angle_perspective": "Eye-level most common for relatability, low angles for power dynamics, high angles for vulnerability, perspective serves story",
    "subject_relationship": "Primarily candid and unposed, authentic moments preferred, minimal photographer intervention, natural expressions",
    "environment": "On-location shooting exclusively, real-world environments, no studio setups, natural context essential"
