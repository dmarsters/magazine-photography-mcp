  "name": "Still Life Photography",
  "technical": {
    "focal_length": "85-135mm for classic distortion-free rendering, 50mm for environmental context, macro lenses for extreme detail work",
    "depth_of_field": "Variable - shallow DOF for selective focus and bokeh, deep DOF for sharp detail throughout composition",
    "shutter_speed": "1/60s to several seconds, often slower speeds due to controlled lighting and tripod use",
    "lighting": "Controlled studio lighting - softboxes, diffusers, reflectors, window light, multiple light sources for shadow control",
    "camera_format": "Medium format preferred for maximum detail and tonal gradation, full-frame digital, large format for commercial work"
  },
  "aesthetic": {
    "composition": "Rule of thirds, triangular arrangements, leading lines, careful negative space management, geometric balance",
    "subject_background": "Clean, uncluttered backgrounds that complement subject, often neutral tones or textured surfaces",
    "tonal_range": "Full tonal range preferred, subtle gradations, controlled contrast, rich shadows and highlights",
    "color_approach": "Harmonious color relationships, monochromatic schemes, complementary palettes, often muted or saturated depending on intent",
    "texture_detail": "High emphasis on surface textures, material qualities, sharp detail rendering, tactile visual qualities"
  },
  "shooting_approach": {
    "subject_distance": "Close to medium distances allowing detailed subject rendering while maintaining compositional context",
    "angle_perspective": "Eye-level to slight overhead angles, occasionally dramatic low angles for impact, precise viewpoint selection",
    "subject_relationship": "Highly controlled and deliberate arrangements, formal composition, intentional object relationships",
    "environment": "Primarily controlled studio environments, occasionally natural window light setups, minimal environmental distractions"

    ],
    "historical_context": "Emerged with early photography in 1840s, influenced by Dutch Golden Age paintings, evolved through pictorialism to modernist approaches",
