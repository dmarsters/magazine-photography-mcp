  "technical": {
    "focal_length": "24-85mm most common, wide angles (14-35mm) for environmental context, 50-135mm for portraits, telephoto (70-200mm) for sports/events",
    "depth_of_field": "Variable based on story needs - shallow f/1.4-f/2.8 for subject isolation, deep f/5.6-f/11 for environmental context and multiple subjects",
    "shutter_speed": "1/60s-1/250s for portraits and interviews, 1/500s+ for action/events, sometimes slower for intentional motion blur storytelling",
    "lighting": "Natural light preferred when possible, minimal flash intervention, bounce flash or LED panels for indoor work, maintaining authentic atmosphere over perfect lighting",
    "camera_format": "Full-frame DSLR/mirrorless dominant, medium format for high-end magazines, occasionally 35mm film for specific aesthetic"

  "aesthetic": {
    "composition": "Rule of thirds, leading lines, strong geometric elements, asymmetrical balance, negative space to accommodate text layout, multiple focal points",
    "subject_background": "Background provides context and story information, environmental elements support narrative, minimal backgrounds only when subject is the complete story",
    "tonal_range": "Full tonal range preserved, moderate contrast, shadow detail retention important, highlights controlled to avoid blown areas",
    "color_approach": "Natural color palette reflecting real environment, muted tones common, color grading subtle and story-appropriate, black and white for timeless or serious subjects",
    "texture_detail": "High detail retention throughout frame, textures support storytelling, fabric, architectural, and skin textures rendered naturally"
  },
  "shooting_approach": {
    "subject_distance": "Varies widely - close portraits (3-6 feet), environmental shots (10-30 feet), establishing shots (50+ feet), dictated by story requirements",
    "angle_perspective": "Eye level most common, slight variations for visual interest, low angles for empowerment themes, high angles for vulnerability, Dutch angles rare",
    "subject_relationship": "Mix of posed and candid moments, subjects aware of camera but natural, authentic expressions prioritized over perfect poses",
    "environment": "On-location shooting dominant, subjects in their natural or relevant environments, studio only when environmental context unnecessary"
