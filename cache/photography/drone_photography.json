    "focal_length": "Wide angle 24-35mm equivalent, some 50-85mm for compression effects",
    "depth_of_field": "Deep DOF (f/5.6-f/11) for maximum sharpness across frame",
    "shutter_speed": "1/250s or faster for stability, 1/60s for intentional motion blur",
    "lighting": "Golden hour and blue hour preferred, even overcast for diffused light",
    "camera_format": "Small sensor (1/2.3\" to APS-C), 12-48MP, 4K video capability"

  "aesthetic": {
    "composition": "Rule of thirds, leading lines, geometric patterns, symmetry from above",
    "subject_background": "Subject integrated into larger landscape context, patterns emerge",
    "tonal_range": "High dynamic range, balanced exposure, detail in shadows and highlights",
    "color_approach": "Enhanced saturation, polarized blues and greens, warm/cool contrast",
    "texture_detail": "Sharp detail throughout frame, surface textures emphasized from aerial view"
  },
  "shooting_approach": {
    "subject_distance": "50-400 feet altitude typical, varies from intimate to expansive views",
    "angle_perspective": "Straight down (orthogonal), 45-degree angles, low altitude reveal shots",
    "subject_relationship": "Subjects unaware or posed for scale, emphasis on environment over individual",
    "environment": "Outdoor locations, coastal areas, urban environments, natural landscapes"
