    "focal_length": "35-85mm for balanced perspective, 24-35mm for environmental context, 85-200mm for compressed backgrounds and subject isolation",
    "depth_of_field": "Variable - shallow DOF for subject isolation and bokeh, deep DOF for sharp environmental detail and maximum information",
    "shutter_speed": "1/60s to 1/250s for handheld work, longer exposures 1-30s+ for motion blur and ethereal effects, tripod-mounted precision work",
    "lighting": "Controlled natural light preferred, golden hour and blue hour, diffused artificial lighting, dramatic directional light for mood, minimal fill flash",
    "camera_format": "Medium format (6x6, 6x7) and large format (4x5, 8x10) for maximum detail and tonal range, high-end full-frame digital"

  "aesthetic": {
    "composition": "Rule of thirds, leading lines, symmetry, negative space emphasis, classical proportions, deliberate framing with strong geometric structure",
    "subject_background": "Background as integral compositional element, environmental context supporting conceptual meaning, careful separation or integration based on artistic intent",

    "color_approach": "Muted earth tones, desaturated palettes, monochromatic schemes, or selective color emphasis for emotional impact",

  "shooting_approach": {
    "subject_distance": "Variable from intimate close-ups to expansive environmental views, distance chosen to serve conceptual intent",
    "angle_perspective": "Eye-level and slightly elevated angles most common, low angles for dramatic impact, perspective chosen for psychological effect",
    "subject_relationship": "Highly deliberate and composed, planned rather than spontaneous, formal arrangement with attention to every element",
    "environment": "Both studio and location work, natural environments preferred, architectural spaces, controlled lighting conditions essential"
