  "name": "Architectural Photography",
  "technical": {
    "focal_length": "Wide-angle 14-35mm for exteriors and interiors, 50-85mm for details, tilt-shift lenses for perspective correction",
    "depth_of_field": "Deep DOF (f/8-f/16) to maintain sharpness throughout the frame, occasional shallow DOF for detail isolation",
    "shutter_speed": "Tripod-based long exposures (1/15s to several seconds), especially for twilight and interior lighting",
    "lighting": "Golden hour and blue hour preferred, HDR techniques for high contrast scenes, artificial lighting for interiors, light painting",
    "camera_format": "Full-frame and medium format cameras for maximum detail and dynamic range, high-resolution sensors essential"
  },
  "aesthetic": {
    "composition": "Emphasis on geometric patterns, leading lines, symmetry, rule of thirds, vertical and horizontal line correction",
    "subject_background": "Building integrated with surrounding context or isolated against sky, minimal distracting elements",
    "tonal_range": "Full tonal range with detailed shadows and highlights, often HDR processing for interior-exterior balance",
    "color_approach": "Natural color rendition emphasizing material textures, warm interior lighting contrasted with cool exterior light",
    "texture_detail": "Sharp detail in materials (concrete, glass, steel, wood), surface textures and patterns emphasized"
  },
  "shooting_approach": {
    "subject_distance": "Variable from wide establishing shots to intimate detail close-ups, often multiple distances for comprehensive coverage",
    "angle_perspective": "Low angles for monumentality, eye-level for human scale, elevated positions for context, corrected verticals",
    "subject_relationship": "Formal documentation approach, occasional human elements for scale, emphasis on design intent",
    "environment": "Primarily location-based, natural context essential, occasional studio work for architectural models"
  },

      "Historical preservation"
    ],
    "historical_context": "Emerged in 1850s with architectural documentation needs, evolved with modernist movement emphasizing clean lines and form",
    "key_characteristics": "Perspective correction, emphasis on form and function, geometric composition, attention to lighting and materials",
