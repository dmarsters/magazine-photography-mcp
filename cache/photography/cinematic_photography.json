    "focal_length": "35mm-85mm for narrative scenes, 24-35mm for environmental shots, 85mm+ for character portraits and close-ups",
    "depth_of_field": "Shallow to medium DOF (f/1.4-f/4) for subject isolation, deeper DOF (f/5.6-f/8) for establishing shots",
    "shutter_speed": "1/60s-1/250s to maintain natural motion blur, avoiding overly frozen or blurred movement",
    "lighting": "Dramatic directional lighting, three-point setup, strong contrast with controlled shadows, often moody and atmospheric",
    "camera_format": "Full-frame sensors preferred, often shot in 16:9 or 2.35:1 aspect ratios to mimic film formats"
  },
  "aesthetic": {
    "composition": "Rule of thirds, leading lines, symmetry, deep focus layers, careful framing that tells a story",
    "subject_background": "Background serves narrative purpose, creates depth and context, often blurred but meaningful",
    "tonal_range": "High contrast with deep blacks and bright highlights, dramatic tonal separation",
    "color_approach": "Stylized color grading with orange/teal, desaturated or monochromatic palettes, mood-driven color temperature",
    "texture_detail": "Rich textures in foreground, atmospheric haze or grain, film-like quality with controlled sharpness"
  },
  "shooting_approach": {
    "subject_distance": "Varies by shot type: wide establishing shots, medium shots for interaction, close-ups for emotion",
    "angle_perspective": "Low angles for power, high angles for vulnerability, Dutch tilts for tension, eye-level for intimacy",
    "subject_relationship": "Posed but natural, directed moments that feel authentic, emphasis on emotion and narrative",
    "environment": "Location-based shooting preferred, natural or constructed sets that support story, atmospheric conditions"
